# HTML Code Cleaner

**HTML Code Cleaner** is a lightweight, browser-based tool designed to clean up messy or bloated HTML code. It removes unnecessary `<div>` wrappers, strips out inline `style`, `class`, and `id` attributes, and allows you to replace any HTML tag (like `<h2>` with `<h3>`) through a user-friendly dropdown interface.

Ideal for web developers, WordPress users, or content editors who work with HTML copied from rich-text editors, page builders, or document files.

## Features

- Remove all `<div>` tags while preserving their inner content.
- Strip `class`, `id`, and `style` attributes from all elements.
- Replace any HTML tag (e.g., `h2` → `h3`) using dropdowns.
- Automatically format and indent cleaned HTML.
- One-click button to copy the cleaned output to your clipboard.

## Usage

You can use this tool directly in your browser via GitHub Pages:
